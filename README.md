# Light and Magic

This project aims to provide a plug n' play black box built on the .NET Micro Framework that can be used to monitor light emission. Data recorded is written to an SD card. Use the data to manage your lighting usage as you see fit.

Built with:
* Fez Spider mainboard
* LightSense
* ColourSense
* SD Card module
* Display T35
* Wifi RS21
* Camera

## Configuration
Configuration is done through a config.json file that should be on the root directory of the SD card. An example config file can be found [here](https://github.com/sBaildon/light-and-magic/blob/master/Light%20and%20Magic/config.json). 

## Usage
Assemble. Plug in. Touch screen. Done.

## Xively
Light and Magic communicates with Xively to enable itself in the Internet of Things network. The data feed can be found [here](https://xively.com/develop/f20rKr_j8v1rZmO-mMFp).
